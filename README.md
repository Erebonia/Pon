# Potato the Traveler | 2D Action RPG Game

## What is it?
A project I made to learn and understand the Godot Engine.

The foundation of this game was created via this tutorial https://youtu.be/mAbG8Oi-SvQ?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a, but has been upgraded from Godot 3.7 > Godot 4.2.1. I have repaired all the code to make it compatible with this newer version of Godot and as a result it's able to access and utilize Godot Engine's newer features and bug fixes.

### What's New?
- New main character: Potato
- New landscape / tilemap
- Healthbars in combat and Canvas UI
- Invincibility Frames on evasion

### Core Features
- Player Movement
- State Machine (IDLE, ROLLING, ATTACK)
- Tilemaps, textures, and collisions
- YSortnode in order to display player behind or in front of objects such as trees, grass, etc...
- Enemy Wandering AI
- Enemy has player detection and will follow to initiate combat
- Knockback enemies on attack
- Death Effects
- Player Camera & Border limits
- Sound FX / Hit Flashes
