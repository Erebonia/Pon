# 🧩 Pon | Modular 2D Action RPG Engine (Built in Godot)

I developed **Pon** as a modular and scalable 2D Action RPG engine to explore core gameplay architecture, real-time systems design, and game engine scripting using **Godot**. What began as a personal learning project evolved into a fully-featured game platform with procedural content generation, FSM-driven entities, save/load systems, and robust RPG mechanics.

## 🎮 What is it?
Initially a project I made to learn and understand the Godot Engine turned into a full blown 2D Action RPG.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🧑‍🚀 New main character: Pon  
- 🕹️ A combat system with 8-directional movement, dashing, and various attack combos  
- 🧱 **The Depths** – A procedural-based dungeon with boss encounters every N floors  
- 🎬 Scene Manager for changing maps  
- 💾 Save system for retaining player data  
- 🧰 Inventory and hotbar system  
- 🤖 Player and Enemy state machines for scalability and clean logic  
- 📈 Level-up and RPG stat system  
- 🌦️ Time-based dynamic weather system  

...and much more!

## 📚 Honorable Mentions  
The game's original concept was based off this tutorial, but has since made enormous strides in development. Credits to **Heartbeast** for helping me understand and create the foundation of my game.  
Special thanks to **MakerTech** and **Devworm** for various tutorials and information regarding Godot.
