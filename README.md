# Potato the Traveler | 2D Action RPG Game

## What is it?
A project I made to learn and understand the Godot Engine. I have repaired and upgraded the base project from Godot 3.7 to be compatible with the latest Godot 4.2.1 Engine.

## Credit
I learned how to create the foundation of the game through the series below. Credits to Heartbeast.
